# 🚀 AI Agent Skills for OpenCode & Claude

A collection of reusable workflows and "on-demand" instructions for OpenCode and Claude Code. These skills help reduce context bloat by loading specific instructions only when the agent determines they are necessary.

## 📂 Directory Structure

For these skills to be discovered automatically, place them in one of the following locations:

| Scope | Path (OpenCode/Claude compatible) | 
| ----- | ----- | 
| **Project-local** | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | 
| **Global (User)** | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | 
| **OpenCode Specific** | `.opencode/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | 

### Example Layout

**CLAUDE**

```text
.claude/skills/
└── git-expert/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Main instructions & frontmatter
    ├── scripts/          # Optional helper scripts
    └── templates/        # Optional reference files

```

**OPENCODE**

```text
.opencode/skills/
└── git-expert/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Main instructions & frontmatter
    ├── scripts/          # Optional helper scripts
    └── templates/        # Optional reference files

```

## 🛠️ How to Create a Skill

Each skill must be a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. It starts with a YAML frontmatter block that tells the agent when to trigger the skill.

### `SKILL.md` Template

```markdown
---
name: git-expert
description: Guidelines for writing professional git commits and managing branches.
---

# Git Expert Skill
When this skill is active, you must follow these rules:
1. Always use conventional commit prefixes (feat, fix, docs).
2. Limit the first line to 50 characters.
3. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.

## Examples
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in worker`

```

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Discovery

Both Claude Code and OpenCode will scan your configured directories. When your prompt matches the description in a skill's frontmatter, the agent will automatically load those instructions into its context.

### Manual Invocation

* **Claude Code**: Use `/skill-name` (e.g., `/git-expert`) to force-load the instructions.
* **OpenCode**: Use the `skill_use` tool or simply ask the agent to "load the git-expert skill."

## 📜 Best Practices

1. **Keep Descriptions Concise**: The description field is what the LLM uses to decide if the skill is relevant. Keep it under 200 characters.
2. **Lazy Loading**: Use skills for heavy documentation (like API specs) instead of putting them in `CLAUDE.md` to save on token costs.
3. **Versioning**: Include a version or license field in your frontmatter if sharing publicly.

## ⚠️ Model Variability

- Outcomes may vary by LLM. Because different models (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs. GPT-4o vs. Llama 3) have different training biases and reasoning capabilities, the same skill definition may yield different results.

- Instruction Adherence: Highly capable models (like Sonnet) follow strict rules better than smaller, faster models (like Haiku).

- Tone & Style: A skill asking for "professional" output may result in different styles depending on the base model's personality.

Constraint Handling: Some models may ignore negative constraints (e.g., "don't do X") if the prompt is too long.

## 🧠 Model Sensitivity & Reliability

To ensure your skills work reliably across different environments, follow these reliability principles:

1. The "Reasoning Gap"

Large reasoning models can interpret vague heuristics, but smaller models require explicit "Step-by-Step" instructions. If your skill fails on smaller models, break the logic into an ordered list.

2. Anchor with Examples

Examples are the most effective way to normalize output across different LLMs. Providing 2-3 "Golden Examples" reduces the chance of a model hallucinating a different format.

3. Temperature Sensitivity

In OpenCode, ensure your opencode.json temperature is set appropriately.

Low Temp (0.0 - 0.2): Best for strict skills (code style, git commits).

High Temp (0.7+): Best for creative or brainstorming skills.
