# Commands (Business Logic)

Commands encapsulate business rules in platformOS following the **build, check, execute** pattern. They provide a structured, testable approach to all create, update, and delete operations using pos-module-core helpers.

## Key Purpose

Commands are the single place for business logic in a platformOS application. They enforce a strict three-stage pipeline that separates data construction, validation, and persistence. This keeps pages thin (controller-only) and partials focused on presentation.

## When to Use

- Creating, updating, or deleting any record in the database
- Validating user input before persistence
- Encapsulating business rules that must be enforced consistently
- Operations that should optionally trigger side effects (events)
- Any data mutation that needs to be callable from pages, background jobs, or other commands

Do NOT use commands for:
- Read-only queries (use `app/lib/queries/` instead)
- Pure presentation logic (use partials)
- One-off data transformations with no persistence

## How It Works

```

1. **Build** -- Assemble a data object from input parameters using `parse_json` and `modules/core/commands/build`.
2. **Check** -- Validate the object against a JSON array of validators using `modules/core/commands/check`.
3. **Execute** -- If `object.valid` is true, persist via `modules/core/commands/execute` with a GraphQL mutation.

The result object always contains `valid` (boolean), `errors` (hash), and the original data fields.

## Getting Started

1. Create a command file at `app/lib/commands/<resource>/<action>.liquid` (e.g., `app/lib/commands/products/create.liquid`).
2. Implement the three stages: build, check, execute.
3. Call from a page via `{% function result = 'lib/commands/products/create', title: title, price: price %}`.
4. Check `result.valid` to determine success or failure.
5. On failure, re-render the form with `result.errors` for display.

Minimal command:

```liquid
{% parse_json object %}
  { "title": {{ title | json }} }
{% endparse_json %}
{% function object = 'modules/core/commands/build', object: object %}

{% parse_json validators %}
  [{ "name": "presence", "property": "title" }]
{% endparse_json %}
{% function object = 'modules/core/commands/check', object: object, validators: validators %}

{% if object.valid %}
  {% function object = 'modules/core/commands/execute', mutation_name: 'products/create', selection: 'record_create', object: object %}
{% endif %}
{% return object %}
```
